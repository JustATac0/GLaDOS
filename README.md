Code for the discord bot from this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIUqm8k1VOY&amp;lc=UgyNN_NTW5IvWNbMKYZ4AaABAg

***IMPORTANT*** 

You will need to add your bot's token to a text file named 'gladtoken.txt' if you would like to use this code raw. You will also need to provide your own mp3 file for the song named 'stillalive.mp3' as I am not able to provide it myself. Both files should be present in the same folder/directory as the python file unless otherwise specified.
